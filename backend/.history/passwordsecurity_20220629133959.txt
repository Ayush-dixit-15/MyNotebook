The password in our database should not be stored in as a plain text because if we do so, and any attacker somehow gets the access of our database, our account will get hacked.So, developers came up with a solution for this sort of a problem known as HASHING. So,what happens in hasing is whenever you create a password , the backend runs a hash function(this hash function is a one-way function that creates a hash of a particular password and hash is a string of any number of characters. Now, every password is given its unique hash. For example of the password is Ayush and lets say its hash is 133@hw. So, if anyone sets the password Ayus, the hash would be completely different, it could be 43r434)
